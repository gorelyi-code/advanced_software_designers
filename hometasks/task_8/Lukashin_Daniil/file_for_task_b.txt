Into the vast world of words, opening with tenderness,
On the RuStych site you'll find comfort.
The classics are there, like a starry trail,
Feelings and thoughts that are in your heart.

The magic of rhymes that drive you crazy,
Love and passion as if in the power of evil.
The light of happiness and joy, the shadows of anxiety,
Gathered here are all the souls of the road.

Fears and pains, invisible threads,
The words of the poets are like a light of discovery.
Dive into the whirlpool where feelings boil,
There's a world beyond your dreams, a world beyond your dreams, a world beyond your dreams.

As the mood, so are the lines,
There's everything from joy to tears that block.
Whether it's a tender whisper of love that burns,
Or a bitter sting when your heart aches.

On this site the soul is in a magic weave,
In poems of love to win and to run.
Here everyone will find what is so sweet to him,
There's always power in the world of poetry.

A literary stream where time stands still,
The magic of words that matures and sees in the heart.
On RuStich is the art that gently calls,
At every moment, sweet fruit for the soul.
